### Week #1 - The Awakening

Get your software set up:

1. [Install R](http://cran.stat.sfu.ca/)
2. [Install RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
3. [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/)
4. [Set-up Github account](https://github.com/)
5. [Get free student account](https://education.github.com/)
6. [Connect R Studio with Github](http://www.r-bloggers.com/rstudio-pushing-to-github-with-ssh-authentication/), or try [here](http://www.molecularecologist.com/2013/11/using-github-with-r-and-rstudio/)
7. Become familiar with **commit**, **pull**, **push** routine.
8. Upload your first `README.md` to your new repository!

#### Assignment 1 - The Markdown Challenge

Here you will upload a personal `README.md` file to your repository telling us about yourself and what steps you took to get the `README.md` to show up on your Github repository. You must include the following in your `README.md`:

1. _italics_, **BOLD**, <span style="color:magenta">colour</span>, etc.
2. A header (try different levels)
3. A [link](http://spatial.ly/2014/11/r-visualisations-design/)
4. Bullet points/numbering
5. An image of your choice

Spice your page up and experiment, as everyone will be viewing it at one point. Use the forumn [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) to get some ideas or to answer any questions you may have. There are some good resources there, and if you have a question, chances are it has already been answered there. I continue to rely on my favourite [Google](google.ca) when I'm stuck. Next week, some of you will be selected to present your progress and how you handled *The Markdown Challenge*.

If you are anything like this:
